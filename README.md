# Career Convo - AI ChatBot
## Description
This project is an AI-powered personal assistant designed to represent me, Rohan Soni, on my personal website. Built using a local LLM (via OpenAI-compatible API), Gradio, and Pushover, the chatbot simulates realistic, engaging conversations with visitors—particularly recruiters, collaborators, or clients—interested in my background.

Key Features:

Personalized Responses: The chatbot uses my CV (parsed from PDF) and LinkedIn summary (from text) to answer questions about my skills, experience, and career.

Intelligent Tooling: It includes tool call support to:

Log questions it cannot answer.

Record and notify me of interested users via email capture.

Local LLM Integration: Powered by Ollama's local LLM (e.g., LLaMA 3), ensuring privacy and fast performance without relying on external APIs.

Real-Time Notifications: Uses Pushover API to alert me of user interest or unknown queries.

Interactive UI: Gradio provides a clean, chat-style interface for smooth interactions.

This chatbot serves as a smart, always-on personal representative, perfect for portfolio sites or professional introductions.
