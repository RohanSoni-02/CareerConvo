My name is Rohan Soni, I’m a software developer who loves building things that actually solve problems. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Swinburne, where I was awarded a 75% Scholarship and consistently made it to the Dean’s List. I’ve already worked on AI tools, real-time communication systems, and e-commerce apps using Python, React, and C++. I’m passionate about tech that makes an impact and I’m always keen to connect with people doing great work.
